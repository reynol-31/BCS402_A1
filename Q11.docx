The Current Program Status Register (CPSR) is an important register in ARM architecture that holds information about the current state of the processor. This includes flags for conditional execution, control bits, and the current processor mode.

The CPSR can be broken down into four main fields:
1. Flags (bits 31–28): These are condition flags used for conditional instructions.
N (Negative)
Z (Zero)
C (Carry)
V (Overflow)

2. Reserved bits (27–8): These are not used typically and should remain unchanged.

3. Control bits (7–0):
Q (Saturation flag – bit 27)
I (IRQ disable – bit 7)
F (FIQ disable – bit 6)
T (Thumb state – bit 5)

4.Mode bits (4–0): Indicates the processor mode like User, FIQ, IRQ, SVC, etc.
Now, based on the conditions mentioned:

Zero flag is set, so Z = 1

Other flags N, C, V, Q are clear, so N = 0, C = 0, V = 0, Q = 0

Thumb state is active, so T = 1

IRQ interrupts are enabled, so I = 0

Processor is in SVC mode, which is 10011 in binary (for mode bits)

Here’s how the CPSR layout would look (only the relevant bits are shown for clarity):

| N | Z | C | V | Q |  ...  | I | F | T | Mode  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  ...  | 0 | x | 1 | 10011 |

N = 0
Z = 1
C = 0
V = 0
Q = 0
I = 0 (enabled)
T = 1 (Thumb state)
Mode = 10011 (SVC mode)
This register is super useful during debugging and context switching because it tells us the exact state the processor is in.
